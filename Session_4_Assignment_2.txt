c) yarn-site.xml
d) Hadoop-env.sh

Ans: d.

5. Which MapReduce daemon instantiates user code, and executes map and reduce tasks on a cluster running MapReduce vl (MRvl)? 
a) NameNode 
b) DataNode 
c) JobTracker 
d) TaskTracker

Ans: d. 

6. Identify the function performed by the Secondary NameNode daemon on a cluster configured to run with a single NameNode. 
a) In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode performs a checkpoint operation on the files by the NameNode. 
b) In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode is standby NameNode, ready to failover and provide high availability. 
c) In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode performs deal-time backups of the NameNode. 
d) In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode servers as alternate data channel for clients to reach HDFS, should the Name Node become too busy.

Ans: a

7. Hadoop administrators write a script called Topology script to determine the rack location of nodes. It triggers to know the distance of the nodes to replicate the data and Configures this script in ________.
a) yarn-site.xml 
b) Hadoop-env.sh 
c) core-site.xml 
d) mapred-site.env

Ans: a.

8. __________is the master that arbitrates all the available cluster resources and thus helps manage the distributed applications running on the YARN system
a) Node manager 
b) data manager
c) ResourceManager (RM) 
d) Taskmanager

Ans: c.

9. _________take instructions from the ResourceManager and manage resources available on a single node.
a) NodeManagers  
b) data manager
c) ResourceManager (RM) 
d) Taskmanager

Ans: a.

10. How does HDFS Federation help HDFS Scale horizontally? 
a) HDFS Federation improves the resiliency of HDFS in the face of network issues by removing the NameNode as a single-point-of-failure. 
b) HDFS Federation allows the Standby NameNode to automatically resume the services of an active NameNode
c) HDFS Federation provides cross-data center (non-local) support for HDFS, allowing a cluster administrator to split the Block Storage outside the local cluster. 
d) 
e) HDFS Federation reduces the load on any single NameNode by using the multiple, independent NameNode to manage individual pars of the filesystem namespace.

Ans: a.
